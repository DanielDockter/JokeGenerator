# JokeGenerator

Setup Instructions

For this program I used the requests libary, which I am not sure is included with Python by default. 

How to Run This Program

1. Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: I believe I used this.

Requests Library: Install it via pip:

pip install requests

2. Clone or Download the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt I suppose.

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/DanielDockter/JokeGenerator.git

Navigate to the project directory:


3. Running the Program

Run the script with:

python main.py I believe..

Follow the menu displayed in the terminal:

Option 1: Fetch a new joke and save it.

Option 2: View all saved jokes.

Option 3: Clear all saved jokes.

Option 4: Exit the program.

The menu explains itself well enough. 

Or just copy the code from github and put it in VisualStudio code adding the requests pip and etc, it should work perfectly fine that way as well.
