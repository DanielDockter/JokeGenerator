# JokeGenerator
Setup Instructions
For this program I used the requests libary, which I am not sure is included with Python by default. 

How to Run This Program
1. Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: I believe I used this.
Requests Library: Install it via pip:

Copy code
pip install requests

2. Clone or Download the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt I suppose.

Clone this repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DanielDockter/JokeGenerator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code

3. Running the Program

Run the script with:

Copy code
python main.py I believe..

Follow the menu displayed in the terminal:

Option 1: Fetch a new joke and save it.
Option 2: View all saved jokes.
Option 3: Clear all saved jokes.
Option 4: Exit the program.

The menu explains itself well enough.
